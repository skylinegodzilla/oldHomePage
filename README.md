# oldHomePage
This is a old personal homepage I made for myself years ago when I was self studying jquery. It is dated though and I want to make a new one with modern CSS3 and HTML5 content.

This was a project that eventhough its dated I have been using as my persional homepage for years.
I created it when I was studdying jquery and created a few intresting things from js animations to paralax scrolling and Google/Wikipeda serch boxes.
Now though with modern CSS3 animations and other nifty things from HTML5 and more, I plan on building a new modern page in the near future.
